# **Vulnerability Assessment Report**

## **1st January 20XX**

## ---

# **System Description**

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# **Purpose**

*A database server is crucial to a business as it stores, organizes, and provides access to critical data such as customer information, transactions, inventory, and employee records, enabling smooth and efficient operations. Securing this data is vital to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and loss of sensitive information, which could lead to legal consequences, financial loss, and reputational damage. If the server were disabled due to a cyberattack, technical failure, or lack of maintenance, it could halt business operations, disrupt services, delay decision-making, and erode customer trust, significantly impacting the company’s performance and credibility.*

# **Risk Assessment**

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  *Hacker* | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | *3* | *3* | *9* |
| *Competitor* | Alter/Delete critical information | 2 | *3* | *6* |
| *Past employees* | Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. | *2* | *2* | *4* |

# **Approach**

The three risks listed above:**data exfiltration and tampering by competitors**, and **DoS attacks by past employees** are chosen because of their potential to severely disrupt business operations and compromise sensitive data.Competitors gaining access to confidential information could result in loss of competitive advantage,alteration or deletion of critical data could lead to operational failures and regulatory violations. Past employees may carry insider knowledge, making them capable of launching DoS attacks against the server.

# **Remediation Strategy**

First, limiting who can access sensitive data using separation of duties and principle to least privilege ,and strong passwords with two-factor authentication helps keep information safe. Encrypting important files will make it difficult for the competitors to alter or delete sensitive information.  To stop denial-of-service attacks, firewalls can block suspicious traffic before it causes harm. Finally, removing access immediately when an employee leaves ensures they can’t come back and cause damage later. These simple actions go a long way in protecting the business.
